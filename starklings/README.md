# Starklings notes

A collection of things I've learned from [Starklings](https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1).
Note that since I am already familiar with Rust, I'm only writing about new things I have learned. This is probably not the best source to read if you are completely new to rust-like syntax. This collection of notes exists to explore the subtle differences between Cairo and Rust.
